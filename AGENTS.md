## Dev environment tips
- use `pnpm` as default package manager.
- Use `pnpm dlx turbo run where <project_name>` to jump to a package instead of scanning with `ls`.
- Run `pnpm install --filter <project_name>` to add the package to your workspace so Vite, ESLint, and TypeScript can see it.
- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right name—skip the top-level one.
